# VizualizrStudio
A WIP FOSS Dj Program made with .NET MAUI and ðŸ’œ

Major backlog items include:
 - [ ] MIDI support + mapping customization
 - [ ] Audio mixing, better streams, effects and the like
 - [ ] Track analysis for stats such as BPM and Key.
 - [ ] State retention - to recover in case of crash
 - [ ] Mac support (though i'm currently using NAudio).

# Libraries in use
NAudio       -  loading audio samples and determining sample rates - Will be removed as it's windows only.
PortAudio    -  Audio renderer.
SyncFusion   -  Controls


# Building
Basic .NET MAUI build, but currently i'm experimenting with SyncFusion for better controls - which will need a community license locally to build.
